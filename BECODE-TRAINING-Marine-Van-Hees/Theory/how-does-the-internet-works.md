# How does the internet works?

__*The internet works thanks to the cables buried in the ground which connects all our machines whether the cables are copper, optical fiber or occasionally beam to satellites or through cell phone networks.*__

## 1. Servers:

*A server is a special computer who is directly connected to internet.*

+ Files or web pages are on the server's hard drive.
+ Every server has a unique Internet Protocol address (IP address)

>[!NOTE]
>IP addresses help computers find each other.

## 2. Home computer:

The computer at home is not a server because it's not connected directly to the internet. Home coputers are called __clients__ because they're connected indirectly to the internet through an internet service provider (ISP).
